Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

Known Issues:
- The AUTOPILOT HEADING (HDG) and NAV buttons are not synchonized. PILOT in Command will have to set Autopilot HDG and NAV bottons and when swapping controls the new pilot will have to do the same. 


*** Please kindly note that this plane from MSFS has numerous unselectable switches. This is a MSFS model/featureset issue, not a YC's or the Profile I created issue.

FIXED:
  # 10/22/2024 
    - Reported issue for line 375. Fopund a few blank Vars
  # 10/17/2024
    - Initial release 10/17/2024


I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
